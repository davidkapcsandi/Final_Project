Hello Visitor.
This project has been made for QA Bootcamp as my final project.
I started it with huge confidence and I estimated I will finish by Wednesday. Guess what? It is Thursday and I am still working on it, so I underestimated the task.
I felt like writing the code itself went quickly and well, I came across new issues, but after hours of research I could solve it.
Jira and Git were the hardest even though it shouldn't be so I definitely have to go over those recordings again.
Sometimes I had to look up even basics, but I am sure with more practice I will be able to do these kind of tasks easier and quicker. After the course I will keep up with coding because this is my new passion.
I am going to attach Screenshots of every CRUD function plus one.

Please see the following links as a proof of API + mySQL functions:
